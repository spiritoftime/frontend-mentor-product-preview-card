what i learnt:

1. use logical css properties (so instead of max width, use max-inline-size for example)
2. declare variables at :root for easy reference
3. images have a lot of specifications; srcset and sizes. it is also important to provide an alt
4. use clamp to scale text responsively and vw

queries: how do i make this more responsive? for example, for .card right now i have set max-inline-size: 37.5rem; so you can see that beyond that its really not responsive anymore.
